# Rising Gun Violence in Toronto: An Analysis of Shootings and Firearm Discharges

## Overview

In this paper, we study reported shootings and gun incidents in Toronto from 2004 to 2024. Our analysis identifies key trends over time in different neighborhoods, showing higher-risk areas, seasons, and times of day. The data suggest that there may be a relationship between these factors. This study provides important insights that will help the Toronto Police Service improve security measures and effectively target high-risk areas through increased police presence.
